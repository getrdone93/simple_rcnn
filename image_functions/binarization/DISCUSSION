main.py was developed on my machine. It runs on the CPU, so no special
hardware is needed. The python3 interpreter was designed to accept main.py,
so do not use python 2. The specific python3 interpreter is 3.6.8. The required
libraries can all be installed via pip3. Here is the list:
          - argparse
          - tkinter
          - PIL
          - cv2

This program features three representative test cases and a GUI that let's
the user interact with the binarization function. It uses numpy to make things
easier when manipulating images and is simple in design. It uses disk, so make
sure the images directory is writable. 
One problem is that the GUI is not refreshable, so the program must be 
restarted for the new binary file to be seen in the window. Also, there
is output in the console log for when the GUI reads the original image
or binary image. It also lets you know where the new binarized image
was written.
