Programs written by me:
         - main.py

main.py runs the GUI and performs the binarization. Example run:
        python3 main.py --image images/apple.jpeg

The application will write a new image at the location of the given
image of the name binary-{file_name}.{file-ext}. So the above run
produced binary-apple.jpeg. This output file is used by the gui
to load the adjustments made by the user. The GUI, however, cannot
interactively load the new file, so the GUI must be stopped and then
restarted after every adjustment.

To run the test cases, simply pass a case argument in {1, 2, 3}. Example:
        python3 main.py --case 1

The --image argument will be ignored when running test cases. When the example
images pop up on your screen, simply hit 'q' and then enter to quit out of 
the currently executing python process. There is an explanation that is output
in the console that describes the given example input and output.

Directories:
    images - This directory contains sample images. The application will
             write here when running the above example.
