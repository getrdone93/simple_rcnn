Programs written by me:
         - demo.py
         - region_proposer.py
         - split_coco.py

demo.py runs the examples for the project. Example run:
        python3 demo.py

split_coco.py is responsible for splitting a dataset. This file can provide the
input split for the training portion. A histogram is created where the number of
objects less than a given area per image serve as the bins. The images with 5 objects
less than 32 * 32 are chosen for the split. You can adjust the split percentage, but 
it must in the range (0, 1). Example usage:

     mkdir -p ./data/test
     mkdir -p ./data/train
     
     download the appropriate year and annotations file:
     http://cocodataset.org/#download

     Run the script:
     python3 split_coco.py --from-image-path <images_directory> --annotations <annotations_file.json> --to-train-path ./data/train/ --to-test-path ./data/test/ --split-percent .8

region_proposer.py is the neural network responsible for suggesting regions of
interest to the classification neural network, i.e. VGG16. This network can 
be trained with a dataset and annotation file.
